Hello traveller!

You have wandered the vast reaches of the internet only to find yourself on a page about statistics. This looks like one of those rather unexciting journeys you do for a side quest, maybe something about earning your degree as a social scientist? Ugh, not that boring stuff again. Social science is supposed to be about human beings, not about numbers. All this math is so hard to understand, this will be so tedious and nerve-wrecking.

Or will it?

This is a learning website designated to social science students, scholars and everyone else who wants to learn about the quantitative methods of the social sciences. Its aim is to provide educationally well-designed and low-threshold explanations, visualizations and examples of quantitative methods and concepts commonly found in social science BA and MA curricula. Prepare to master statistics!

Oh, and remember to bring a towel.
